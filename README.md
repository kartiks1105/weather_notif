# A Python script that sends weather updates to my phone every morning.

Living in Canada, winters can be brutal and it is absolutely necessary to check the weather forecast for the day before leaving home. I made the mistake of not doing this a few days back and paid the price by catching a cold.

Given that mornings can be really busy, I thought it would be great to get updates rather than having to go seek them. 

This Python script sends the weather prediction for the day to my phone at 7:30am every morning. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather updates and used Cron as my job scheduler.
